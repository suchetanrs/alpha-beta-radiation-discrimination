# alpha-beta-radiation-discrimination
This repository contains the simulation files and code to differentiate between alpha and beta radiation in nuclear systems that I developed when I was an intern at IGCAR ( Indhira Gandhi Center For Atomic Research ), Kalpakkam, Chennai.

Steps for running the simulation:
1. Install Proteus 8
2. Install STM32 Cube IDE
3. Open the Proteus Project file.
4. Load the .hex file from the STM32 project file onto the STM32 board on proteus.
5. Run.
